# Hi there! 👋🏼
I'm Kanishka, an aspiring **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer** with a passion for uncovering the stories that data has to tell. Just as I immerse myself in history and narratives, I approach data with the same curiosity—seeking patterns, connections, and insights that reveal a bigger picture. My strong foundation in computer science fuels my exploration, while my love for learning and problem-solving drives me to grow in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **natural language processing**. The stories behind data fascinate me, and I'm excited to tell them through innovative solutions.
